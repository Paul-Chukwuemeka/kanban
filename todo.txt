### To-Do List

**High Priority (Core Functionality):**
1.  **Task Management:**
    -   [DONE] Implement "Edit Task" functionality. This includes creating an "Edit Task" modal.
    -   [DONE] Implement "Delete Task" functionality. This should be accessible from the task view.
    -   [DONE] Implement subtask completion. The checkboxes in `viewTask.tsx` should be functional.
    -   [DONE] Implement moving tasks between columns. The dropdown in `viewTask.tsx` should be functional.
2.  [DONE] **Drag and Drop:** Implement drag-and-drop for tasks between columns on the main board view. This is a key feature for a Kanban board.

**Medium Priority (UI/UX Improvements & Bug Fixes):**
1.  [DONE] **Form Validation:** Add validation to all forms (add/edit board, add/edit task) to handle empty inputs and other potential errors.
2.  **Subtask Management:**
    -   [DONE] Allow adding new subtasks to a task.
    -   [DONE] Allow editing existing subtasks.
    -   [DONE] Allow deleting subtasks.
3.  **UI Polish:**
    -   Provide feedback to the user after an action is performed (e.g., "Task created successfully").
    -   Improve empty states (e.g., for columns with no tasks).
    -   Ensure the UI is fully responsive for different screen sizes.
    -   [DONE] Fix the hardcoded `true` values in `viewTask.tsx` for subtask completion.

**Low Priority (Code Quality and Future Features):**
1.  **Refactoring:**
    -   Break down large components like `page.tsx` into smaller, more manageable components.
    -   Improve TypeScript typings and remove any `any` types.
2.  **Testing:**
    -   Write unit tests for Redux slices and helper functions.
    -   Write component tests for the main components.
    -   Write end-to-end tests to simulate user flows.
3.  **User Authentication:**
    -   Add user authentication to allow multiple users to have their own boards.
    -   Replace `localStorage` with a database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB) to store user data.
4.  **Backend:**
    -   Create a proper backend API to handle data persistence instead of relying on `localStorage`.
